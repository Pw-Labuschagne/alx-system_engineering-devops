Secured and monitored web infrastructure


#1.Firstly we have 3 firewalls.

What is a firewall:

	*A firewall is a division between a private network and an outer network, which manages the traffic that is passing between two networks.
	
	*It can be implemented either through hardware(a physical appliance that is deployed to enfore a network boundry) or software(a network
	 security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic).

	*Firewalls is also considered to be both networking and security technology.

	*Considered as the bare minimum for standard network security.

What would be the purpose of our firewalls?
	
	-They will be implemented to protect the network from unwanted and unauthorized users.
	-It will monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.
	-Prevent malicious software from accessing a computer or network via the internet.


#2.Now we need a SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS

What is a SSL certificate:
	
	*It is a bit of code on your web that provides security for online communications.

	*They are small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser.

	*This ensures that all data passed between the web server and the browser remain private.

What is the purpose of our SSL certificate?

	-It will be used to ensure encrypted communication(traffic) between th web server and an external network.
	-It would prevent malicious data snagging.
	-It will also be used to ensure privacy and integrity alongside identification.


#3.Next we need 3 monitoring clients.(data collection for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

What is a monitoring serive:

	*A monitoring service is used in different ways namely: Server monitoring and application monitoring.

	*Application monitoring is getting data about software you are running and ensuring that it is behaving as expected.

	*Server monitoring is getting data about your physical(or virtual) server and ensuring they are not overloaded(any thing from CPU,
	 memory, disk or network overload).

What is the purpose of our monitoring clients:

	-It will be used to collect data on how quickly the website loads in to the browser with detailed analysis at every level of the stack.
	-Used to gather performance data of the application components.
	-Checkk how the browser is responding from multiple connections(locations) around the globe.
	-Will be used to analyse the operations of the server and measure its overall health status.
	-It will also run self tests to ensure that accessibility of the server is intact along with the function to display alerts on any
	 missing or corrupt files that could cause all sorts of security issues aswell as violations that could occur.

How does the monitoring tools collect data:

	-There is a broad spectrum of monitoring that can take place ex. availibility monitoring, basic wesite and api monitoring, server availibility ect.
	-The main focus of the monitoring and collectin of data is:
		*1.Initiates a connection with website or service - Is it available?
		*2.Checks the return for a response code - Is it responding as expected?
		*3.Checks the return specified content - Is the website acting as expected?
		*4.Loads the content into a real browser (real browser monitoring) - Capture a 'point in time'
		*5.Records load times for each page element as it loads int he browser (performance monitoring) - Is it performing?
		*6.Does self tests and attempt to log in, conduct a search ect.(web application monitoring) - Is it good?
		*7.Reports all the findings back to the monitoring service(client) - Visualises it in alerts, dashboards and reports.


We also have to ask ourselfs how is traffic served over HTTPS?

	*HTTPS pages typically use one of two secure protocols. The one we will be using is a SSL(Secure Socket Layer) and the other is TLS(Transport
	 Layer Security). Both these securties is known as 'asymmetric' which means a PKI(Public Key Infrastructre) system is used.
	
	*HTTPS uses thes protocols(TLS & SSL) to encrypt communications so that attackers can't steal the data. These security protocols also confirms
	 the identification of the website to prevent impersonations. This is one of the main reasons for cyber attacks.


Now we sit with the following questions:

#1.Why terminating SSL at the load balancer is an issue:

	*Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers unencrypted

#2.Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue

	*Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure, this means
	 future implemetations could cause more trouble than needed.

#3.Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem

	*Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory,
	 I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem. A setup such
	 as this is not easily scalable. Fault finding and maintenance will also be extended, as it will be difficult to spot identify the 
	 root cause of the error.

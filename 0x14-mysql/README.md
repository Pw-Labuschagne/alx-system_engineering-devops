MySQL I guess, tasks are:

#0.First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.
#1.In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.
#2.In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.
#3.Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.
#4.Having a replica member on for your MySQL database has 2 advantages:

    Redundancy: If you lose one of the database servers, you will still have another working one and a copy of your data
    Load distribution: You can split the read operations between the 2 servers, reducing the load on the primary member and improving query response speed

#5.What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost. That’s why you want to backup and store them in a different system in another physical location. This can be achieved by dumping your MySQL data, compressing them and storing them in a different data center.

Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.

Requirements:

    The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases
    The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql
    The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive
    This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz
    The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root
    The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
